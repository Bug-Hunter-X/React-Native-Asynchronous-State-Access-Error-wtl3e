This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when you have asynchronous operations that update the state, but you're trying to access the state before the update completes.  For example, consider this code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text>  {/* Error here if data is still null */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `useEffect` hook fetches data asynchronously.  If you try to render `data.name` before the data has been fetched and set, you will get a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')` error.
